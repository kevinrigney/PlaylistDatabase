# You'll need some pre-requisites to run this

# At bare minimum you'll need these
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-requests libfontconfig1 python3-pip mysql-server python3-mysql.connect

sudo pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client

# And you'll need to set up your database user
# Change the playlist_user and super_secret_password to the
# credentials you will use in PlaylistDatabaseConfig.ini
# Notice we only give this user limited credentials

# Once you have changed the usernam and password
# log in to your databse as root and run:

create database PlaylistDB;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on PlaylistDB.* TO 'root'@'127.0.0.1';
grant select, insert, update on PlaylistDB.* to 'playlist_user'@'127.0.0.1' identified by 'super_secret_password'

# Then you should be able to run main.py in python3 or edit 
# run.sh to correctly run the program
